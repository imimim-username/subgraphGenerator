# {{ name }}

This subgraph indexes events from smart contracts on the **{{ network }}** network.

## Overview

- **Network**: {{ network }}
- **Mapping Mode**: {{ mappings_mode }}
- **Complexity**: {{ complexity }}

## Contracts

{% for contract in contracts %}
### {{ contract.name }}

- **Address**: `{{ contract.address }}`
- **Start Block**: {{ contract.start_block }}
{% if contract.events %}
- **Events Indexed**:
{% for event in contract.events %}
  - `{{ event }}`
{% endfor %}
{% endif %}

{% endfor %}

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v16 or later)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)
- [The Graph CLI](https://thegraph.com/docs/en/developing/creating-a-subgraph/)

### Installation

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Or using yarn
yarn install
```

### Development Commands

```bash
# Generate AssemblyScript types from schema and ABIs
npm run codegen

# Compile the subgraph
npm run build
```

### Deployment

#### Subgraph Studio (Recommended)

1. Create a subgraph on [Subgraph Studio](https://thegraph.com/studio/)
2. Authenticate with your deploy key:
   ```bash
   graph auth --studio <DEPLOY_KEY>
   ```
3. Deploy:
   ```bash
   npm run deploy
   ```

#### Local Graph Node

```bash
# Create the subgraph locally
npm run create-local

# Deploy to local node
npm run deploy-local

# Remove the subgraph (if needed)
npm run remove-local
```

## Project Structure

```
{{ name }}/
├── abis/              # Contract ABIs
{% for contract in contracts %}
│   └── {{ contract.abi_path }}
{% endfor %}
├── src/
│   └── mappings/      # Event handler mappings
{% for contract in contracts %}
│       └── {{ contract.name }}.ts
{% endfor %}
├── schema.graphql     # GraphQL schema
├── subgraph.yaml      # Subgraph manifest
└── package.json
```

{% if mappings_mode == "stub" %}
## Next Steps

This subgraph was generated with **stub mappings**. The mapping files contain
TODO comments that show you how to implement the event handlers.

1. Open the mapping files in `src/mappings/`
2. Implement the event handlers by uncommenting and customizing the example code
3. Run `npm run codegen` to regenerate types after any schema changes
4. Run `npm run build` to compile your changes
